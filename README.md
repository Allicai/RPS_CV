A Rock-Paper-Scissors game that uses OpenCV for real-time hand gesture recognition, enabling players to control game actions through gestures.

Run `rps.py`, and click `s` to begin the countdown. Clicking `d` will toggle a cheatmode, where the AI is unbeatable, waiting a few milliseconds after the player's input to pick the winning option every time.

Keep in mind that the hand gestures should be made vertically, e.g. two fingers pointing up if your choice is scissors.
